Hello guys, my name is Kenny. I must tell you that this is an amazing innovation from Piggyvest in helping my savings culture. I can now easily put money away that would have been lavished and assured of rewards for it. Please join me in exploring this new world of savings management.

I joined piggyvest while doing my NYSC, I used my PPA allowance but saved my federal government allowance. What I saved, I used it as an independent lady to learn how to drive, apply for my master's program, rent a house in Abuja, and learn some skills. If you have the spirit of saving, you can actually save from any income/money and Piggyvest is there to help me hold it till I need it.
